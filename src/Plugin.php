/**
 * Playlist porting, as a first-party bundled plugin (S-311).
 *
 * Phase 2 of the porting feature (S-309): the desktop/server face of it. The
 * porting engine — parsing, matching, playlist creation — lives entirely in this
 * plugin (S-315): its services, job, model, migration, API routes and the admin
 * screen that drives them, contributed through the plugin seams rather than added
 * to core. Bundled and always on, so a fresh server can import a playlist from
 * day one; disabling it removes the table, the endpoints and the page together.
